"""Build the SAP Supply Chain 360 presales kit documents.

Mirrors the Supply Chain Ontology kit so the two read as a set:

    00_START_HERE.docx              what is in the kit and which file to open
    03_SE_Quick_Start.docx          positioning, demo path, objections
    05_Architecture_and_Install.docx the medallion stack and how to stand it up
    06_Setup_and_Access.docx        the three region deployments and how to get in

Every figure below was verified against the account on 2026-09-21 rather than
copied from existing docs, because several of those disagreed with each other:
